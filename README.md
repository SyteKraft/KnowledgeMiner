# KnowledgeMiner
## Description
KnowledgeMiner is a app system for developing literature reviews across different use cases and academic and professional levels.
KnowledgeMiner makes it easy to keep track of all your research, from organizing citations to creating bibliographies and summaries. With KnowledgeMiner, you can quickly search for and find relevant studies, read and highlight key points, and easily export your review to any document format. With powerful search capabilities and detailed analysis features, KnowledgeMiner is the perfect tool for powering your literature reviews.
## The System Components
We will have a number of components for this app:
- a web app for engaging directly in the use cases for the app system;
- a set of connectors for various web browsers, with which to capture sources from which reviews can be developed; and
- an API for interacting with data sources.
## Proposed Features
Our aim is to develop an app system with these features:
- search capabilities 
- bibliography and citation management
- the ability to highlight important points and notes
- the ability to import and export documents in a variety of formats, and
- the ability to collaborate with other researchers and share annotated reviews.
